# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Alzheimer Disease Diagnosis  

The diseases that are one of the most difficult to cure are neurodegenerative diseases. One of these diseases is Alzheimer which is known to be among the leading causes of dementia. Its permanent cure is yet to be discovered, making its early detection all the more prudent. The current treatment which is based on stabilising the symptoms becomes difficult if the disease is detected at a later stage. Deep Learning has infinite potential in the healthcare industry and is used in different diagnosing tools as well as research. In this poject, we have tried to build a model to diagnose early stage Alzheimer with a better accuracy and minimal loss of data than previously found. We have based our research on Convolutional Neural Networks, taking the dataset available on Kaggle. Five random CNN models namely ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, Inception and Xception were selected and trained. ResNet showed the best performance and was chosen to be further modified to better the accuracy reaching 95.5%.
